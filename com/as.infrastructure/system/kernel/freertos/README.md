# FreeRTOS

#### http://www.freertos.org/
#### Version 8.2.0

## Why I choose FreeRTOS?
* Free
* Widely Used
* Rich Feature and plugin
* Well Supported
* CAN be simulated on WIN32/POSIX platform
* GPL license

#### Yes, there is of course a lot of good RTOS, such as ucOS/nxtOSEK/tk-kernel/rt-thread, but for me, FreeRTOS is already good enough.

#### Here, I do work on the FreeRTOS win32 simulation
