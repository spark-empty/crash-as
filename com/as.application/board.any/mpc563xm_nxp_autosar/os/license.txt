During this period the Licensee may not disclose Freescale's Confidential Information to any third party except where such disclosure is necessary in order to achieve the purpose of the license because the automotive customer requires disclosure in conjunction with the testing or purchase of an Authorized System and who have executed written agreements obligating them to protect such Confidential Information. During this period Licensee will also limit dissemination of the Confidential Information to its employees or contractors who have a need to know of the Confidential Information and who have executed written agreements obligating them to protect such Confidential Information, and may not use the Freescale's Confidential Information for any purpose not authorized by this Agreement. The Licensee further agrees to use the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, with Freescale's Confidential Information as it would with its own confidential information. The Licensee may disclose Confidential Information as required by a court or under operation of law or order provided that the Licensee notifies Freescale of such requirement prior to disclosure, that the Licensee discloses only that information required, and that the Licensee allows Freescale the opportunity to object to such court or other legal body requiring such disclosure.
