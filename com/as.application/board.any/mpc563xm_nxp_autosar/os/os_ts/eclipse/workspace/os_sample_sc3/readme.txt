This folder contains Tresos Studio configuration project for the OS 
sample\standard\sc3. It can be imported by Tresos import project function.

The sample should be built by calling sample\standard\sc3\makefile with 
option cfg=xdm.  To do so you may need to set path to the tresos_cmd.bat tool
if you didn't set it during installation time, or move the tool or put a wrong
path.

For more information how to build and run samples please refer to their 
documentation.
